![HomeCooked web app home page](public/images/readme/launch.png)

There are few things in life as comforting as a home-cooked meal. 

Whether you are missing your parents' simple meals, or looking to share your cooking talents (and earn a little cash on the side), Homecooked is the site for you!

HomeCooked is a web-based application that aims to connect people who share a love for homecooked meals. This application is currently only available on desktop.

# [Visit HomeCooked Here!](https://christinew2-homecooked.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started
From the Welcome Page, the user is greeted with two options: 
1. "Explore the Cravings" - brings you to a view of all the dishes that users want to eat.
2. "Check Out the Meals" - brings you to a view of all the dishes that users are able to cook. 

In order to add your own dishes or interact with existing postings, the user will have to log in.
